# 🛍️ E-Commerce Database Design Project

## 📚 Overview

This project is part of the **Power Learn Project (PLP)** curriculum and aims to help learners master the fundamentals of **database design and modeling**. The task was to collaboratively create an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and implement the structure of an **e-commerce database** from scratch.

## 🎯 Objective

- Design a robust database schema suitable for an e-commerce platform.
- Understand and map out relationships between real-world entities like products, categories, and variations.
- Foster team collaboration using tools like **draw.io**, **GitHub**, and **SQL**.
- Implement and document all schema elements in a `.sql` file.

## 🔄 Data Flow

We designed the database to support:
- Flexible product variations (color, size)
- Multiple images per product
- Grouping of product attributes for detailed listings

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for ERD design
- MySQL syntax for SQL implementation
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
